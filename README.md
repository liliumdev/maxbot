# maxbot

A very basic Silkroad Online (MMO) bot using SR33 - Drew Benton's proxy framework. Developed in the beginning of 2009, the bot is a plugin to SR33 and it's code is located in Plugin/cbot.cpp and Plugin/Plugin.cpp. Parsing of packets was done using many resources, amongst other things some Silkroad server emulators at the time and manual analysis and reverse engineering of the SRO_Client.exe executable.

This is now on Github purely for archival and educational purposes.
