This project was created in Visual Studio 2008.

The "Bin" folder will contain the built files after a successful build.
There needs to be two folders in the "Bin" folder, "Debug" and "Release".
In the "Debug" and "Release" folders, there needs to be a folder named "Plugin".

When a Release configuration solution is built, "SR33.exe" and "Detour.dll" will
be copied into the "Bin\Release" directory. The plugins will be copied into the
"Bin\Release\Plugins" folder.
